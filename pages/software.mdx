## Installing and Updating Software Safely

### What is Software Installation and Updating?

Software installation refers to the process of adding new applications or programs to a computer or device. Updating software involves downloading and installing the latest versions or patches to improve functionality, fix bugs, or address security vulnerabilities.

### Why Are Software Installation and Updates Important?

Keeping software up to date is critical for maintaining security and performance. Threat actors often exploit vulnerabilities in outdated software to gain unauthorized access to systems and data. Regular updates can protect Innovatech Solutions from potential threats.

## Best Practices for Installing Software

- **Download from Official Sources:** Always download software from the official website or trusted sources. Avoid third-party sites that may host malicious versions of software.
- **Only download from HTTPS sites:** HTTPS is secure; HTTP is not.
- **Read User Reviews:** Look for feedback and ratings from other users to assess the reliability and safety of the software.
- **Understand Permissions:** Review the permissions that the software requests during installation. Be cautious if it asks for more access than necessary.
- **Use Antivirus Software:** Ensure your antivirus software is enabled and up to date before downloading and installing new applications.

- **Backup Before Updating:** Create a backup and save any active data on your workstation before installing any updates or upgrades to prevent data loss in case of issues.
- **Stay Informed:** Follow vendor announcements and security bulletins to stay aware of known vulnerabilities and available patches.
- **Always restart your computer after updates when prompted to do so.**
